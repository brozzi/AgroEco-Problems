# AgroEco-Problems

# Week 12 comments

## My project takes my raw soil data from the EREC lab and modifies it to be visualized for reports and papers. So far, the only data that is being used is Carbon. 
## The files to be reviewed are DataCarpentry_analysis_final.R and Analysis_plan.R
## I attempted to create a function that would use each variable of the original Soil_data to calculate the change for each, but I haven't finished it yet. I only have the code for Carbon so far.
## My next steps in the analysis to complete for the future are to make my script work for each and every type of analysis from the soil and from the plant tissue (e.g. pH, M3P, WHC). That way, I can just plug in new numbers or a new data file when I want to look at something different. 

# Learning Experience
## This course was a great introduction to using R for my research and has helped set me up for continued optimization of my future analyses. The sequential order of the course made things easy to follow and most of the readings were very helpful in figuring out my own code. I learned a lot from it and am glad I took the course my first semester.
## My feedback for future students is to not worry about getting overwhelmed, the key is persistence and the solutions will become clearer as you continue to research and look for ideas. The greatest tools I used outside of this course were online discussion boards like Stack Overflow. There is a ton of information out there and a lot of knowledgeable people offering support. Many people have had the same problems as you and in most cases, I was able to find the answers I was looking for that have already been answered. There is a ton of information on R on the web and I would highly recommend taking a look at how others approach things.
